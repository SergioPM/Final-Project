        Hello, you might be wondering what this mini site I have created is.
        From the title you might have an idea of what it is but there's more to it.
        Personally, when I was introduced to photoshop I thought I was going to
        be using pictures, croping them and doing things like adding different
        people's heads to different bodies. However, there's a couple more things
        like drawing and annimations. If you're new to photoshop than this is the
        perfect place to be. I'll show you some things and have you get tested on
        the way.
      </p>

        Before I can help you extend you knowledge on Photoshop, I had to start
        from somewhere. In the beginning of second semester I signed up for a class
        where I would learn how to use Photoshop. After weeks of this course, I
        have a pretty good knowledge on this and can help people learn most of
        basics. Since the semester is about to end, I'm greatful for learning it
        because you never know when it can be useful in the future.
