            <p>When editing an image or drawing, brushes are the way to go. There's so
              many things you can do with them. In the image above, you can see more
              things than just the brushes icon. There's many ways to stylize the artwork
              you're working with.

          <div class="trace">
            <p>Tracing is not that important to learn but it's pretty useful. It's
              pretty fun when you can trace random images you find. It's useful
              in situtations where you plan on drawing a certain thing but don't
              know how to. The tracing tool not hard to use because it just
              consists of connecting dots.

            <div class="animation">
              <p>The last thing im going to talk about photoshop is animations.
                To me it's one of the best things when experiementing with photoshop.
                Just be warned it's pretty fun to use this feature but it's also
                pretty tedious. To start animating, you must use the timeline
                feature. To look for anything in Photoshop, just press
                ctrl + f or Command + f. You can import a video and will be on
                the timeleine. You can use the pen tool to trace the video.

            <div class="forques">
              <p>How do you think animations are made?</p>

                  <input type="radio" value="A" name="cc">
                  A. You draw/trace more than fifty times to get an animation of
                  a couple seconds.<br>

                  <input type="radio" value="B" name="cc">
                  B. You download another program to assist you on to drawing things
                  for you so you don't have to do anything. <br>

      <p>Now that you've went through my site, I hope you have learned atleast
        one thing. Know that there is more to Photoshop, these were just some of
        the basics to get you started. Personally, I wouldn't know how to use this
        application if it wasn't for one of my class I'm currently taking. I've
        learned quite a few things and hopefully if you're still interested in
        learning more, explore the net. You'll find valuable information to help you
        get started on your journey on leanring Adobe Photoshop CS6.
